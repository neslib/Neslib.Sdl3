    [Neslib.Sdl3.Time](../Reference/Neslib.Sdl3.Time/index.md)

SDL provides time management functionality. It is useful for dealing with (usually) small durations of time.

This category covers measuring time elapsed ([SdlGetTicks](../Reference/Neslib.Sdl3.Time/routines/SdlGetTicks.md), [SdlGetPerformanceCounter](../Reference/Neslib.Sdl3.Time/routines/SdlGetPerformanceCounter.md/)), putting a thread to sleep for a certain amount of time ([SdlDelay](../Reference/Neslib.Sdl3.Time/routines/SdlDelay.md), [SdlDelayNS](../Reference/Neslib.Sdl3.Time/routines/SdlDelayNS.md), [SdlDelayPrecise](../Reference/Neslib.Sdl3.Time/routines/SdlDelayPrecise.md)), and firing a callback function after a certain amount of time has elasped ([SdlAddTimer](../Reference/Neslib.Sdl3.Time/routines/SdlAddTimer.md), etc).

There are also useful functions to convert between time units, like [SdlSecondsToNS](../Reference/Neslib.Sdl3.Time/routines/SdlSecondsToNS.md) and such.
